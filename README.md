nRF24L01 chip interface 

For this project I interfaced two nRF24L01 chips with two seperate arduino boards. The result being I can flip a switch connected to one chip which turns on an LED connected to the second chip/arduino.

Parts used:
 Arduino Uno (x2)
 nRF24L01 chip (x2)
 switch
 LED
 wires
 
 In the tabs above I have included my code for the transciever and also receiver as well as the schematics I referenced. All of the links I used are also in a references tab. The code I ended up using is a combination of all of the sites I referenced. I had to take parts from each code and adjust them in order to fit my project, using a switch and an LED.
